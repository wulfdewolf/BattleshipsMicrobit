# BattleshipsMicrobit
The battleships game coded for BBC Microbits (in C)

The actual code is in the Code folder.
If not interested in the code you can just copy/paste the hex file to the microbit's directory and enjoy the game.
Multiplayer is supported so copy/pasting to 2 microbits can be done.

This was a project for my second Bachelor year in Computer science for the course Structure of Computerprograms II.
We only learned C in the course but this project uses some C++ modules.

The 'compile-microbit' file is a bash script that can be run to automatically compile all code via yotta.
It will also copy/paste the compiled hex-file to a mounted microbit if one is present.
